    of chemical reactions and generates hundreds of molecular species and
    radicals during the process. In this work, a neural network-based molecular
    dynamics (MD) simulation is carried out to simulate the benchmark combustion
    of methane. During MD simulation, detailed reaction processes leading to the
    creation of specific molecular species including various intermediate
    radicals and the products are intimately revealed and characterized.
    Overall, a total of 798 different chemical reactions were recorded and some
    new chemical reaction pathways were discovered. We believe that the present
    work heralds the dawn of a new era in which neural network-based reactive MD
    simulation can be practically applied to simulating important complex
    reaction systems at ab initio level, which provides atomic-level
    understanding of chemical reaction processes as well as discovery of new
    reaction pathways at an unprecedented level of detail beyond what laboratory

             complex chemical systems. Central to the method is the potential energy surface (PES) that can
             describe the breaking and formation of chemical bonds. The development of both accurate and
             efficient PES has attracted significant effort in the past 2 decades. A recently developed deep
             potential (DP) model has the promise to bring ab initio accuracy to large-scale reactive MD
             simulations. However, for complex chemical reaction processes like pyrolysis, it remains
             challenging to generate reliable DP models with an optimal training data set. In this work, a
             data set construction scheme for such a purpose was established. The employment of a concurrent
             learning algorithm allows us to maximize the exploration of the chemical space while minimizing
             the redundancy of the data set. This greatly reduces the cost of computational resources required
             for ab initio calculations. Based on this method, we constructed a data set for the pyrolysis of
             n-dodecane, which contains 35 496 structures. The reactive MD simulation with the DP model trained
             based on this data set revealed the pyrolysis mechanism of n-dodecane in detail, and the simulation
             results are in good agreement with the experimental measurements. In addition, this data set shows
             excellent transferability to different long-chain alkanes. These results demonstrate the advantages

                energy surface (PES) models have been proposed that can potentially
                allow us to perform molecular dynamics simulations for large scale
                systems with quantum accuracy. However, making these models truly
                reliable and practically useful is still a very non-trivial task. A
                key component in this task is the generation of datasets used in model
                training. In this paper, we introduce the Deep Potential GENerator
                (DP-GEN), an open-source software platform that implements the recently
                proposed on-the-fly learning procedure (Zhang et al. 2019) and is
                capable of generating uniformly accurate deep learning based PES models
                in a way that minimizes human intervention and the computational cost for
                data generation and model training. DP-GEN automatically and iteratively
                performs three steps: exploration, labeling, and training. It supports
                various popular packages for these three steps: LAMMPS for exploration,
                Quantum Espresso, VASP, CP2K, etc. for labeling, and DeePMD-kit for
                training. It also allows automatic job submission and result collection
                on different types of machines, such as high performance clusters and
                cloud machines, and is adaptive to different job management tools,
                including Slurm, PBS, and LSF. As a concrete example, we illustrate the
                details of the process for generating a general-purpose PES model for Cu

  abstract = { In this work, manganese(II)-doped zinc/germanium oxide nanoparticles (Mn@ZGNPs) 
         have been hydrothermally synthesized to equip with appealing time-resolved luminescence (TRL). 
         Interestingly, we reveal that they can be readily quenched (“turn off”) via a facile surface 
         coating with bioinspired polydopamine (PDA) polymerized from dopamine (DA), resulting from 
         PDA-triggered TRL resonance energy transfer (TRL-RET). By integrated with the thiol-induced 
         inhibition of PDA formation, an ingenious inorganic–organic hybrid tongue-mimic sensor array is 
         thus unveiled for noninvasive pattern recognition of thiols in biofluids in a TRL-RET-reversed 
         “turn on” format toward healthcare monitoring. The sensing principle is based on the new finding 
         that there are differential inhibitions from thiols against the polymerization of DA with 
         various concentrations. Furthermore, density function theory (DFT) studies excellently prove our 
         sensing principle and experimental results, reinforcing the power of the presented system. More 
         importantly, chiral recognition of varied concentrations and mixtures of cysteine enantiomers 
         using our platform are also been demonstrated, promising its practical usage. This is a novel

    abstract = { We present a fast, accurate, and robust approach for determination of free energy profiles and kinetic isotope effects for RNA 2′-O-transphosphorylation reactions with inclusion of nuclear quantum effects. We apply a deep potential range correction (DPRc) for combined quantum mechanical/molecular mechanical (QM/MM) simulations of reactions in the condensed phase. The method uses the second-order density-functional tight-binding method (DFTB2) as a fast, approximate base QM model. The DPRc model modifies the DFTB2 QM interactions and applies short-range corrections to the QM/MM interactions to reproduce ab initio DFT (PBE0/6-31G*) QM/MM energies and forces. The DPRc thus enables both QM and QM/MM interactions to be tuned to high accuracy, and the QM/MM corrections are designed to smoothly vanish at a specified cutoff boundary (6 Å in the present work). The computational speed-up afforded by the QM/MM+DPRc model enables free energy profiles to be calculated that include rigorous long-range QM/MM interactions under periodic boundary conditions and nuclear quantum effects through a path integral approach using a new interface between the AMBER and i-PI software. The approach is demonstrated through the calculation of free energy profiles of a native RNA cleavage model reaction and reactions involving thio-substitutions, which are important experimental probes of the mechanism. The DFTB2+DPRc QM/MM free energy surfaces agree very closely with the PBE0/6-31G* QM/MM results, and it is vastly superior to the DFTB2 QM/MM surfaces with and without weighted thermodynamic perturbation corrections. 18O and 34S primary kinetic isotope effects are compared, and the influence of nuclear quantum effects on the free energy profiles is examined. },

             2018, 14, 5583-5596] that uses a single "low-level" reference
             potential. The gwTP method offers new possibilities in model design
             whereby the sampling generated from several low-level potentials may
             be combined (e.g., specific reaction parameter models that might have
             variable accuracy at different stages of a multistep reaction). The
             gwTP method is especially well suited for use with machine learning
             potentials (MLPs) that are trained against computationally expensive
             ab initio quantum mechanical/molecular mechanical (QM/MM) energies and
             forces using active learning procedures that naturally produce
             multiple distinct neural network potentials. Simulations can be
             performed with greater sampling using the fast MLPs and then corrected
             to the ab initio level using gwTP. The capabilities of the gwTP method
             are demonstrated by creating reference potentials based on the MNDO/d
             and DFTB2/MIO semiempirical models supplemented with the "range-
             corrected deep potential" (DPRc). The DPRc parameters are trained to
             ab initio QM/MM data, and the potentials are used to calculate the
             free energy surface of stepwise mechanisms for nonenzymatic RNA
             2'-O-transesterification model reactions. The extended sampling made
             possible by the reference potentials allows one to identify
             unequilibrated portions of the simulations that are not always evident
             from the short time scale commonly used with ab initio QM/MM
             potentials. We show that the reference potential approach can yield
             more accurate ab initio free energy predictions than the wTP method or
             what can be reasonably afforded from explicit ab initio QM/MM

             This work investigates the mechanism of carbon deposition and
             hydrogenation on an Fe cluster under high-temperature conditions with
             the density functional tight-binding (DFTB) based nanoreactor
             molecular dynamics (NMD) method. Our study shows that successive
             formation of carbon chains, rings, and fused rings occurred during the
             carbon deposition on Fe clusters. Hydrogenation of activated carbon
             happens through direct C-H coupling, while the hydrogenation of
             graphitic carbon involves hydrogenation of the edge carbon, ring-
             opening reaction, and dealkylation reaction. The main function of the
             Fe catalyst is to provide the active sites for H2 dissociation and
             dissociated H spillover, while its activity toward C-C bond breaking
             is limited. These results highlight the role of the DFTB-NMD method as
             an effective tool to investigate reaction mechanisms under operating
             conditions in heterogeneous catalysis.},

             that can be used for the valorization of biomass. Lignin is the second
             most abundant biopolymer in biomass and its conversion is fundamental
             for future energy and value-added chemicals. In this paper, the
             supercritical water gasification process of lignin by employing
             reactive force field molecular dynamics simulations (ReaxFF MD) was
             investigated. Guaiacyl glycerol-{\ensuremath{\beta}}-guaiacyl ether
             (GGE) was considered as a lignin model to evaluate the reaction
             mechanism and identify the components at different temperatures from
             1000 K to 5000 K. The obtained results revealed that the reactions and
             breaking of the lignin model started at 2000 K. At the primary stage
             of the reaction at 2000 K the {\ensuremath{\beta}}-O-4 bond tends to
             break into several compounds, forming mainly guaiacol and
             1,3-benzodioxole. In particular, 1,3-benzodioxole undergoes
             dissociation and forms cyclopentene-based ketones. Afterward,
             dealkylation reaction occurred through hydroxyl radicals of water to
             form methanol, formaldehyde and methane. Above 2500 K, H2, CO and CO2
             are predominantly formed in which water molecules contributed hydrogen
             and oxygen for their formation. Understanding the detailed reactive
             mechanism of lignin{\textquoteright}s gasification is important for
             efficient energy conversion of biomass.</jats:p>},

             Here, we provide an atomic-level understanding of inhomogeneity

             n-decane pyrolysis under supercritical conditions. We describe the

             supercritical n-decane as the coexistence of gas-like and liquid-like
             atoms by a trained machine learning classifier. Due to their specific
             local environment, the appearance of liquid-like atoms under
             supercritical conditions significantly increases the type and

             frequencies of the initial PODEn decomposition reaction at
             {\ensuremath{\alpha}} or {\ensuremath{\beta}} C-O bond show that the
             {\ensuremath{\alpha}} or {\ensuremath{\beta}} C-O bond in PODEn is not
             easy to break, which is approximately half the number of the other
             type of C-O bond dissociation. Furthermore, the bond dissociation
             energies (BDEs) are calculated using the ReaxFF method. The BDE of
             {\ensuremath{\alpha}} or {\ensuremath{\beta}} C-O bond is higher than
             that of the other C-O bond, ~3{\textendash}11 kcal/mol, indicating

             from the initial PODEn decomposition are prone to further reaction,

             comprehend their coupling effects on the decay and safety mechanisms
             of energetic materials. Then, reactive molecular dynamics simulation
             was employed to mimic practical situations and reveal the impact heat
             coupling effect on the decay mechanism of FOX-7. The temperature and
             the degree of compression of the crystal caused by the impact are
             considered variables in the simulation. Both increasing the degree of
             compression and elevating the temperature promotes the decay of FOX-7.
             However, their underlying response mechanism is not the same. The
             acceleration of decomposition is due to the elevated potential energy
             of the FOX-7 molecules because of elevating the temperature. In
             addition to the elevated potential energy of the molecule, the main
             contribution to the decomposition from the compression is to change
             the decomposition path. The results of the analysis show that
             compression reduces the stability of the C=C bond, so that chemical
             reactions related to the double bond occur. In addition,

             provide insights into the decomposition mechanism on atomic level. All

             stimuli loaded on energetic materials. Nevertheless, there is thereby
             an urgent need, but it is still a significant challenge to comprehend
             their coupling effects on the decay and safety mechanisms of energetic
             materials. Then, reactive molecular dynamics simulation was employed
             to mimic practical situations and reveal the impact heat coupling
             effect on the decay mechanism of FOX-7. The temperature and the degree
             of compression of the crystal caused by the impact are considered
             variables in the simulation. Both increasing the degree of compression
             and elevating the temperature promotes the decay of FOX-7. However,
             their underlying response mechanism is not the same. The acceleration
             of decomposition is due to the elevated potential energy of the FOX-7
             molecules because of elevating the temperature. In addition to the
             elevated potential energy of the molecule, the main contribution to
             the decomposition from the compression is to change the decomposition
             path. The results of the analysis show that compression reduces the
             stability of the C=C bond, so that chemical reactions related to the
             double bond occur. In addition, interestingly, the compression along
             the c direction has an almost equal effect on the final product as the
             compression along the b direction. Finally, the decay reaction
             networks are proposed to provide insights into the decomposition
             mechanism on atomic level. All these findings are expected to pave a
             way to understand the underlying response mechanism for the FOX-7
             against external stimuli.},

             contains 2000 PODEn molecules, is simulated at 3000 K. The higher
             frequencies of the initial PODEn decomposition reaction at
             {\ensuremath{\alpha}} or {\ensuremath{\beta}} C-O bond show that the
             {\ensuremath{\alpha}} or {\ensuremath{\beta}} C-O bond in PODEn is not
             easy to break, which is approximately half the number of the other
             type of C-O bond dissociation. Furthermore, the bond dissociation
             energies (BDEs) are calculated using the ReaxFF method. The BDE of
             {\ensuremath{\alpha}} or {\ensuremath{\beta}} C-O bond is higher than
             that of the other C-O bond, ~3{\textendash}11 kcal/mol, indicating
             that BDE is one of the factors causing the different proportions of
             bonds broken. The evolution of pyrolysis products is also
             investigated. The results reveal that long-chain pyrolysis products
             from the initial PODEn decomposition are prone to further reaction,
             while a large amount of CH3O and CH3 remains in the system. This helps
             explain the difficulty in {\ensuremath{\alpha}} and
             {\ensuremath{\beta}} C-O bond dissociation reactions. The results of
             the pyrolysis products are consistent with the result in further
             chemical kinetic simulation. The C2 species in pyrolysis products is
             relatively low, especially for C2H4 and C2H3, which is around zero.

             allows the investigation of the entire decomposition process of bulk
             RDX crystals from an atomic perspective. A series of molecular
             dynamics (MD) simulations are performed on the NNP to calculate the

             that the NNP can accurately describe the physical properties of RDX
             crystals, such as the cell parameters and the equation of state. The
             simulations of RDX thermal decomposition reveal that the NNP could
             capture the evolution of species at ab initio accuracy. The complex
             reaction network was established, and a reaction mechanism of RDX

    abstract = {Asphaltene is the compound with the most complex structure and the
             most difficult degradation in oily sludge, which is the key to limit
             the efficiency of supercritical water oxidation treatment of oily
             sludge. In this paper, the supercritical water oxidation process of
             asphaltene was investigated in terms of free radical reaction,
             degradation pathway, and product generation mechanism using ReaxFF
             molecular dynamics simulation method. The results showed that
             increasing temperature, increasing O2, and increasing H2O have
             different effects on HO2{\textperiodcentered}generation. Benzene rings
             undergo fusion and condensation through hydrogenation abstraction and
             oxygen addition reactions, subsequently breaking down into long-chain
             alkanes. Increasing O2 can effectively promote the ring-opening of
             nitrogen-containing heterocycles. -COOH is the most important
             intermediate fragment for CO and CO2 generation, and there is a
             reaction competition with -CHO3 and -CO3. When the number of oxygen
             molecules increases from 300 to 700, the reaction frequency of -CHO3
             and -CO3 to generate CO and CO2 increases by 17.14{~}{\%} and
             12.77{~}{\%}{\textperiodcentered}H2O determines the production of H2
             by controlling the number of H{\textperiodcentered}radicals present.
             As the amount of H2O increases from 500 to 1500, the product ratio of
             H2 increases from 12.73{~}{\%} to 21.31{~}{\%}. ENVIRONMENTAL
             IMPLICATION: Asphaltene is the most structurally complex organic
             matter in oily sludge, and its presence makes it difficult for oily
             sludge to be completely degraded by conventional treatment methods
             such as pyrolysis and incineration. Polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons
             (PAHs) represented by asphaltene increase the carcinogenicity and
             mutagenicity of oily sludge, and even irreversibly pollute soil and
             groundwater. Supercritical water oxidation, as an efficient organic
             waste treatment technology, can realize harmlessness in a green and
             efficient way. So the study on the mechanism of supercritical water
             oxidation of asphaltene is of great significance for environmental
             protection.},

             of complex chemical mechanisms for hydrocarbon pyrolysis and
             combustion is challenging due to the large number of species and
             reactions involved. Reactive molecular dynamics (RMD) enables the
             simulation of thousands of reactions and the discovery of previously
             unknown components of the reaction network. However, due to the
             inherent imprecision of reactive force fields, it is necessary to
             verify RMD{-}obtained reaction paths using more accurate methods such
             as Density Functional Theory (DFT). We demonstrate a method for
             identification and confirmation of reaction pathways from RMD that
             supplement an established mechanism, using the example of benzene

             pathways from a established soot formation mechanism while also
             indicating new ones. We also show that CHO2016 underestimates hydrogen
             migration barriers by up to  as compared to DFT and can lower
             activation barriers significantly for spin{-}forbidden reactions. This

             developed an in-house toolkit, the Reactive Diffusion Analyzer

             associated Grotthuss, which was not yet achieved previously.
             Meanwhile, RDAnalyzer managed to specifically identify the drift

             friendly fuel, biodiesel has excellent fuel properties comparable to
             those of petrochemical diesel. Oleic acid methyl ester, as the main
             component of biodiesel, has the characteristics of high cetane number
             and low emission rate of harmful gases. However, the comprehensive
             chemical conversion pathway of oleic acid methyl ester is not clear.
             In this paper, the reactive force field molecular dynamics simulation
             (ReaxFF-MD) method is used to construct a model of oleic acid methyl
             ester pyrolysis and combustion system. Further, the chemical
             conversion kinetics process at high temperatures (2500
             K{\textendash}3500 K) was studied, and a chemical reaction network was
             drawn. The research results show that the density of the system has
             almost no effect on the decomposition activation energy of oleic acid
             methyl ester, and the activation energies of its pyrolysis and
             combustion processes are 190.02 kJ/mol and 144.89 kJ/mol,
             respectively. Ethylene, water and carbon dioxide are the dominant and
             most accumulated products. From the specific reaction mechanism, the
             main pyrolysis path of oleic acid methyl ester is the breakage of the
             C-C bond to produce small molecule intermediates, and subsequent
             transformation of the ester group radical into carbon oxides. The
             combustion path is the evolution of long-chain alkanes into short-
             carbon-chain gaseous products, and these species are further burned to
             form stable CO2 and H2O. This study further discusses the microscopic
             combustion kinetics of biodiesel, providing a reference for the
             construction of biodiesel combustion models. Based on this theoretical
             study, the understanding of free radicals, intermediates, and products
             in the pyrolysis and combustion of biomass can be
             deepened.{\ensuremath{<}}/jats:p{\ensuremath{>}}},

             {\ensuremath{<}}jats:p{\ensuremath{>}}In this study, we present a
             novel computational atomistic study of the photothermal decomposition
             behavior of arc plasma on radiation-induced gassing materials
             ablation, studying a polyamide 66 (PA66) system using reactive force
             field (ReaxFF) molecular dynamics (MD). We determine the infrared (IR)
             vibrational frequency of the PA66 permanent molecular dipole using MD
             and then computationally impose an electric field at the same
             frequency to simulate photothermal decomposition by IR, verifying our
             observations with gas chromatography-mass spectrometry (GCMS) of
             experimental decomposition. MD indicates that photothermal
             decomposition reaction is dominated by either cleavage at low
             temperature or cyclization at high temperature. At low temperature,
             initial chain scission takes place at the two amide C{\textendash}N,
             and the remaining chains break down into a variety of molecular
             fragments and free radicals. Further increasing the temperature
             stabilizes a variety of branched chain structures via cyclization,
             debranching and polymerization, with further cleavage forming
             hydrocarbons and volatile small molecule gases. Overall, H{\ensuremath

             adopted. The data set for the DP model of each fuel is constructed
             after 31 and 27 iterations, respectively. The high precision of the DP
             model is demonstrated, and the temperature transferability of each

             tends to form an unsaturated six-membered ring structure, while Fuel 2
             generates unsaturated open-chain hydrocarbons. Further analyses of the
             MD results provide time-evolution information on each component in the
             pyrolysis species pool. Compared to Fuel 1, the initial pyrolysis of
             Fuel 2 leads to more hydrogen, alkenes, and alkanes, as well as fewer
             monocyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (MAHs), demonstrating a reduced
             tendency for afterward coking. This work might contribute to the

    abstract = {ABSTRACT In this paper, the inhibition effects of Ar/He/N2 on the
             H2-O2 system near the extended second explosion limit were
             investigated by ReaxFF simulations. It was found that all three inert
             gases can inhibit the reactions, delaying the initiation reaction, and
             prolonging ignition delay since the generation and consumption of free
             radicals such as HO2 and OH were suppressed. Further, the inhibitory
             effect has the correlation of Ar {\ensuremath{>}} He {\ensuremath{>}}
             N2. The inhibitory effect of Ar is more pronounced compared to He due
             to the bigger effective radius and physical mass. Moreover, the
             addition of N2 introduced extra initiation reaction (H2{\,}+{\,}N2
             {\textrightarrow} NNH{\,}+{\,}H) and generated additional intermediate
             products such as NNH and N2OH, which result in the weakest inhibitory
             effect. Compared to diatomic inhibitors (e.g., N2), the monatomic
             inhibitors such as Ar and He exhibit stronger inhibitory effects on
             the hydroxide reaction under high pressure.},
