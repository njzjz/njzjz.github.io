    of chemical reactions and generates hundreds of molecular species and
    radicals during the process. In this work, a neural network-based molecular
    dynamics (MD) simulation is carried out to simulate the benchmark combustion
    of methane. During MD simulation, detailed reaction processes leading to the
    creation of specific molecular species including various intermediate
    radicals and the products are intimately revealed and characterized.
    Overall, a total of 798 different chemical reactions were recorded and some
    new chemical reaction pathways were discovered. We believe that the present
    work heralds the dawn of a new era in which neural network-based reactive MD
    simulation can be practically applied to simulating important complex
    reaction systems at ab initio level, which provides atomic-level
    understanding of chemical reaction processes as well as discovery of new
    reaction pathways at an unprecedented level of detail beyond what laboratory

             complex chemical systems. Central to the method is the potential energy surface (PES) that can
             describe the breaking and formation of chemical bonds. The development of both accurate and
             efficient PES has attracted significant effort in the past 2 decades. A recently developed deep
             potential (DP) model has the promise to bring ab initio accuracy to large-scale reactive MD
             simulations. However, for complex chemical reaction processes like pyrolysis, it remains
             challenging to generate reliable DP models with an optimal training data set. In this work, a
             data set construction scheme for such a purpose was established. The employment of a concurrent
             learning algorithm allows us to maximize the exploration of the chemical space while minimizing
             the redundancy of the data set. This greatly reduces the cost of computational resources required
             for ab initio calculations. Based on this method, we constructed a data set for the pyrolysis of
             n-dodecane, which contains 35 496 structures. The reactive MD simulation with the DP model trained
             based on this data set revealed the pyrolysis mechanism of n-dodecane in detail, and the simulation
             results are in good agreement with the experimental measurements. In addition, this data set shows
             excellent transferability to different long-chain alkanes. These results demonstrate the advantages

                energy surface (PES) models have been proposed that can potentially
                allow us to perform molecular dynamics simulations for large scale
                systems with quantum accuracy. However, making these models truly
                reliable and practically useful is still a very non-trivial task. A
                key component in this task is the generation of datasets used in model
                training. In this paper, we introduce the Deep Potential GENerator
                (DP-GEN), an open-source software platform that implements the recently
                proposed on-the-fly learning procedure (Zhang et al. 2019) and is
                capable of generating uniformly accurate deep learning based PES models
                in a way that minimizes human intervention and the computational cost for
                data generation and model training. DP-GEN automatically and iteratively
                performs three steps: exploration, labeling, and training. It supports
                various popular packages for these three steps: LAMMPS for exploration,
                Quantum Espresso, VASP, CP2K, etc. for labeling, and DeePMD-kit for
                training. It also allows automatic job submission and result collection
                on different types of machines, such as high performance clusters and
                cloud machines, and is adaptive to different job management tools,
                including Slurm, PBS, and LSF. As a concrete example, we illustrate the
                details of the process for generating a general-purpose PES model for Cu

         have been hydrothermally synthesized to equip with appealing time-resolved luminescence (TRL). 
         Interestingly, we reveal that they can be readily quenched (“turn off”) via a facile surface 
         coating with bioinspired polydopamine (PDA) polymerized from dopamine (DA), resulting from 
         PDA-triggered TRL resonance energy transfer (TRL-RET). By integrated with the thiol-induced 
         inhibition of PDA formation, an ingenious inorganic–organic hybrid tongue-mimic sensor array is 
         thus unveiled for noninvasive pattern recognition of thiols in biofluids in a TRL-RET-reversed 
         “turn on” format toward healthcare monitoring. The sensing principle is based on the new finding 
         that there are differential inhibitions from thiols against the polymerization of DA with 
         various concentrations. Furthermore, density function theory (DFT) studies excellently prove our 
         sensing principle and experimental results, reinforcing the power of the presented system. More 
         importantly, chiral recognition of varied concentrations and mixtures of cysteine enantiomers 
         using our platform are also been demonstrated, promising its practical usage. This is a novel

    abstract = { We present a fast, accurate, and robust approach for determination of free energy profiles and kinetic isotope effects for RNA 2′-O-transphosphorylation reactions with inclusion of nuclear quantum effects. We apply a deep potential range correction (DPRc) for combined quantum mechanical/molecular mechanical (QM/MM) simulations of reactions in the condensed phase. The method uses the second-order density-functional tight-binding method (DFTB2) as a fast, approximate base QM model. The DPRc model modifies the DFTB2 QM interactions and applies short-range corrections to the QM/MM interactions to reproduce ab initio DFT (PBE0/6-31G*) QM/MM energies and forces. The DPRc thus enables both QM and QM/MM interactions to be tuned to high accuracy, and the QM/MM corrections are designed to smoothly vanish at a specified cutoff boundary (6 Å in the present work). The computational speed-up afforded by the QM/MM+DPRc model enables free energy profiles to be calculated that include rigorous long-range QM/MM interactions under periodic boundary conditions and nuclear quantum effects through a path integral approach using a new interface between the AMBER and i-PI software. The approach is demonstrated through the calculation of free energy profiles of a native RNA cleavage model reaction and reactions involving thio-substitutions, which are important experimental probes of the mechanism. The DFTB2+DPRc QM/MM free energy surfaces agree very closely with the PBE0/6-31G* QM/MM results, and it is vastly superior to the DFTB2 QM/MM surfaces with and without weighted thermodynamic perturbation corrections. 18O and 34S primary kinetic isotope effects are compared, and the influence of nuclear quantum effects on the free energy profiles is examined. },

             2018, 14, 5583-5596] that uses a single "low-level" reference
             potential. The gwTP method offers new possibilities in model design
             whereby the sampling generated from several low-level potentials may
             be combined (e.g., specific reaction parameter models that might have
             variable accuracy at different stages of a multistep reaction). The
             gwTP method is especially well suited for use with machine learning
             potentials (MLPs) that are trained against computationally expensive
             ab initio quantum mechanical/molecular mechanical (QM/MM) energies and
             forces using active learning procedures that naturally produce
             multiple distinct neural network potentials. Simulations can be
             performed with greater sampling using the fast MLPs and then corrected
             to the ab initio level using gwTP. The capabilities of the gwTP method
             are demonstrated by creating reference potentials based on the MNDO/d
             and DFTB2/MIO semiempirical models supplemented with the "range-
             corrected deep potential" (DPRc). The DPRc parameters are trained to
             ab initio QM/MM data, and the potentials are used to calculate the
             free energy surface of stepwise mechanisms for nonenzymatic RNA
             2'-O-transesterification model reactions. The extended sampling made
             possible by the reference potentials allows one to identify
             unequilibrated portions of the simulations that are not always evident
             from the short time scale commonly used with ab initio QM/MM
             potentials. We show that the reference potential approach can yield
             more accurate ab initio free energy predictions than the wTP method or
             what can be reasonably afforded from explicit ab initio QM/MM

             heterogeneous catalysis, but its mechanism is not well understood.
             This work investigates the mechanism of carbon deposition and
             hydrogenation on an Fe cluster under high-temperature conditions with
             the density functional tight-binding (DFTB) based nanoreactor
             molecular dynamics (NMD) method. Our study shows that successive
             formation of carbon chains, rings, and fused rings occurred during the
             carbon deposition on Fe clusters. Hydrogenation of activated carbon
             happens through direct C-H coupling, while the hydrogenation of
             graphitic carbon involves hydrogenation of the edge carbon, ring-
             opening reaction, and dealkylation reaction. The main function of the
             Fe catalyst is to provide the active sites for H2 dissociation and
             dissociated H spillover, while its activity toward C-C bond breaking
             is limited. These results highlight the role of the DFTB-NMD method as
             an effective tool to investigate reaction mechanisms under operating
             conditions in heterogeneous catalysis.},

             that can be used for the valorization of biomass. Lignin is the second
             most abundant biopolymer in biomass and its conversion is fundamental
             for future energy and value-added chemicals. In this paper, the
             supercritical water gasification process of lignin by employing
             reactive force field molecular dynamics simulations (ReaxFF MD) was
             investigated. Guaiacyl glycerol-{\ensuremath{\beta}}-guaiacyl ether
             (GGE) was considered as a lignin model to evaluate the reaction
             mechanism and identify the components at different temperatures from
             1000 K to 5000 K. The obtained results revealed that the reactions and
             breaking of the lignin model started at 2000 K. At the primary stage
             of the reaction at 2000 K the {\ensuremath{\beta}}-O-4 bond tends to
             break into several compounds, forming mainly guaiacol and
             1,3-benzodioxole. In particular, 1,3-benzodioxole undergoes
             dissociation and forms cyclopentene-based ketones. Afterward,
             dealkylation reaction occurred through hydroxyl radicals of water to
             form methanol, formaldehyde and methane. Above 2500 K, H2, CO and CO2
             are predominantly formed in which water molecules contributed hydrogen
             and oxygen for their formation. Understanding the detailed reactive
             mechanism of lignin{\textquoteright}s gasification is important for
             efficient energy conversion of biomass.</jats:p>},

             affects reaction behaviors in them. However, explanations for
             inhomogeneity and its effect on reactions are both ambiguous so far.
             Here, we provide an atomic-level understanding of inhomogeneity
             effects on reactions via the computational method, with the example of
             n-decane pyrolysis under supercritical conditions. We describe the
             characteristic pyrolysis behaviors through collective variable-driven
             hyperdynamics (CVHD) simulations and explain the inhomogeneity of
             supercritical n-decane as the coexistence of gas-like and liquid-like
             atoms by a trained machine learning classifier. Due to their specific
             local environment, the appearance of liquid-like atoms under
             supercritical conditions significantly increases the type and
             frequency of bimolecular reactions and eventually causes changes in
             product distributions. Future research with this method is expected to
             extend the effect of inhomogeneity on other reactions under
             supercritical conditions or other condensed phases.},
