  annote =   {Combustion is a complex chemical system which involves thousands
    of chemical reactions and generates hundreds of molecular species and
    radicals during the process. In this work, a neural network-based molecular
    dynamics (MD) simulation is carried out to simulate the benchmark combustion
    of methane. During MD simulation, detailed reaction processes leading to the
    creation of specific molecular species including various intermediate
    radicals and the products are intimately revealed and characterized.
    Overall, a total of 798 different chemical reactions were recorded and some
    new chemical reaction pathways were discovered. We believe that the present
    work heralds the dawn of a new era in which neural network-based reactive MD
    simulation can be practically applied to simulating important complex
    reaction systems at ab initio level, which provides atomic-level
    understanding of chemical reaction processes as well as discovery of new
    reaction pathways at an unprecedented level of detail beyond what laboratory
    experiments could accomplish.},

          automatically identified from the cartesian coordinates

             complex chemical systems. Central to the method is the potential energy surface (PES) that can
             describe the breaking and formation of chemical bonds. The development of both accurate and
             efficient PES has attracted significant effort in the past 2 decades. A recently developed deep
             potential (DP) model has the promise to bring ab initio accuracy to large-scale reactive MD
             simulations. However, for complex chemical reaction processes like pyrolysis, it remains
             challenging to generate reliable DP models with an optimal training data set. In this work, a
             data set construction scheme for such a purpose was established. The employment of a concurrent
             learning algorithm allows us to maximize the exploration of the chemical space while minimizing
             the redundancy of the data set. This greatly reduces the cost of computational resources required
             for ab initio calculations. Based on this method, we constructed a data set for the pyrolysis of
             n-dodecane, which contains 35 496 structures. The reactive MD simulation with the DP model trained
             based on this data set revealed the pyrolysis mechanism of n-dodecane in detail, and the simulation
             results are in good agreement with the experimental measurements. In addition, this data set shows
             excellent transferability to different long-chain alkanes. These results demonstrate the advantages
             of the proposed method for constructing training data sets for similar systems. },

    abstract = {In recent years, promising deep learning based interatomic potential
                energy surface (PES) models have been proposed that can potentially
                allow us to perform molecular dynamics simulations for large scale
                systems with quantum accuracy. However, making these models truly
                reliable and practically useful is still a very non-trivial task. A
                key component in this task is the generation of datasets used in model
                training. In this paper, we introduce the Deep Potential GENerator
                (DP-GEN), an open-source software platform that implements the recently
                proposed on-the-fly learning procedure (Zhang et al. 2019) and is
                capable of generating uniformly accurate deep learning based PES models
                in a way that minimizes human intervention and the computational cost for
                data generation and model training. DP-GEN automatically and iteratively
                performs three steps: exploration, labeling, and training. It supports
                various popular packages for these three steps: LAMMPS for exploration,
                Quantum Espresso, VASP, CP2K, etc. for labeling, and DeePMD-kit for
                training. It also allows automatic job submission and result collection
                on different types of machines, such as high performance clusters and
                cloud machines, and is adaptive to different job management tools,
                including Slurm, PBS, and LSF. As a concrete example, we illustrate the
                details of the process for generating a general-purpose PES model for Cu
                using DP-GEN.

  abstract = { In this work, manganese(II)-doped zinc/germanium oxide nanoparticles (Mn@ZGNPs) 
         have been hydrothermally synthesized to equip with appealing time-resolved luminescence (TRL). 
         Interestingly, we reveal that they can be readily quenched (“turn off”) via a facile surface 
         coating with bioinspired polydopamine (PDA) polymerized from dopamine (DA), resulting from 
         PDA-triggered TRL resonance energy transfer (TRL-RET). By integrated with the thiol-induced 
         inhibition of PDA formation, an ingenious inorganic–organic hybrid tongue-mimic sensor array is 
         thus unveiled for noninvasive pattern recognition of thiols in biofluids in a TRL-RET-reversed 
         “turn on” format toward healthcare monitoring. The sensing principle is based on the new finding 
         that there are differential inhibitions from thiols against the polymerization of DA with 
         various concentrations. Furthermore, density function theory (DFT) studies excellently prove our 
         sensing principle and experimental results, reinforcing the power of the presented system. More 
         importantly, chiral recognition of varied concentrations and mixtures of cysteine enantiomers 
         using our platform are also been demonstrated, promising its practical usage. This is a novel 
         concept of inorganic–organic hybrid-based pattern and chiral recognition platform for TRL 
         background-free sensing and would sprout more novel relevant strategies toward broader 
         applications. },
