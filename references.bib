    abstract = {Asphaltene is the compound with the most complex structure and the
             most difficult degradation in oily sludge, which is the key to limit
             the efficiency of supercritical water oxidation treatment of oily
             sludge. In this paper, the supercritical water oxidation process of
             asphaltene was investigated in terms of free radical reaction,
             degradation pathway, and product generation mechanism using ReaxFF
             molecular dynamics simulation method. The results showed that
             increasing temperature, increasing O2, and increasing H2O have
             different effects on HO2{\textperiodcentered}generation. Benzene rings
             undergo fusion and condensation through hydrogenation abstraction and
             oxygen addition reactions, subsequently breaking down into long-chain
             alkanes. Increasing O2 can effectively promote the ring-opening of
             nitrogen-containing heterocycles. -COOH is the most important
             intermediate fragment for CO and CO2 generation, and there is a
             reaction competition with -CHO3 and -CO3. When the number of oxygen
             molecules increases from 300 to 700, the reaction frequency of -CHO3
             and -CO3 to generate CO and CO2 increases by 17.14{~}{\%} and
             12.77{~}{\%}{\textperiodcentered}H2O determines the production of H2
             by controlling the number of H{\textperiodcentered}radicals present.
             As the amount of H2O increases from 500 to 1500, the product ratio of
             H2 increases from 12.73{~}{\%} to 21.31{~}{\%}. ENVIRONMENTAL
             IMPLICATION: Asphaltene is the most structurally complex organic
             matter in oily sludge, and its presence makes it difficult for oily
             sludge to be completely degraded by conventional treatment methods
             such as pyrolysis and incineration. Polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons
             (PAHs) represented by asphaltene increase the carcinogenicity and
             mutagenicity of oily sludge, and even irreversibly pollute soil and
             groundwater. Supercritical water oxidation, as an efficient organic
             waste treatment technology, can realize harmlessness in a green and
             efficient way. So the study on the mechanism of supercritical water
             oxidation of asphaltene is of great significance for environmental
             protection.},

             of complex chemical mechanisms for hydrocarbon pyrolysis and

             simulation of thousands of reactions and the discovery of previously
             unknown components of the reaction network. However, due to the
             inherent imprecision of reactive force fields, it is necessary to
             verify RMD{-}obtained reaction paths using more accurate methods such

             identification and confirmation of reaction pathways from RMD that

             developed an in-house toolkit, the Reactive Diffusion Analyzer

             Meanwhile, RDAnalyzer managed to specifically identify the drift

             friendly fuel, biodiesel has excellent fuel properties comparable to
             those of petrochemical diesel. Oleic acid methyl ester, as the main
             component of biodiesel, has the characteristics of high cetane number
             and low emission rate of harmful gases. However, the comprehensive
             chemical conversion pathway of oleic acid methyl ester is not clear.
             In this paper, the reactive force field molecular dynamics simulation
             (ReaxFF-MD) method is used to construct a model of oleic acid methyl
             ester pyrolysis and combustion system. Further, the chemical
             conversion kinetics process at high temperatures (2500
             K{\textendash}3500 K) was studied, and a chemical reaction network was
             drawn. The research results show that the density of the system has
             almost no effect on the decomposition activation energy of oleic acid
             methyl ester, and the activation energies of its pyrolysis and
             combustion processes are 190.02 kJ/mol and 144.89 kJ/mol,
             respectively. Ethylene, water and carbon dioxide are the dominant and
             most accumulated products. From the specific reaction mechanism, the
             main pyrolysis path of oleic acid methyl ester is the breakage of the
             C-C bond to produce small molecule intermediates, and subsequent
             transformation of the ester group radical into carbon oxides. The
             combustion path is the evolution of long-chain alkanes into short-
             carbon-chain gaseous products, and these species are further burned to
             form stable CO2 and H2O. This study further discusses the microscopic
             combustion kinetics of biodiesel, providing a reference for the
             construction of biodiesel combustion models. Based on this theoretical
             study, the understanding of free radicals, intermediates, and products
             in the pyrolysis and combustion of biomass can be

             novel computational atomistic study of the photothermal decomposition
             behavior of arc plasma on radiation-induced gassing materials
             ablation, studying a polyamide 66 (PA66) system using reactive force
             field (ReaxFF) molecular dynamics (MD). We determine the infrared (IR)
             vibrational frequency of the PA66 permanent molecular dipole using MD
             and then computationally impose an electric field at the same
             frequency to simulate photothermal decomposition by IR, verifying our
             observations with gas chromatography-mass spectrometry (GCMS) of
             experimental decomposition. MD indicates that photothermal
             decomposition reaction is dominated by either cleavage at low
             temperature or cyclization at high temperature. At low temperature,
             initial chain scission takes place at the two amide C{\textendash}N,
             and the remaining chains break down into a variety of molecular
             fragments and free radicals. Further increasing the temperature
             stabilizes a variety of branched chain structures via cyclization,
             debranching and polymerization, with further cleavage forming
             hydrocarbons and volatile small molecule gases. Overall, H{\ensuremath

             the large size of cellulose molecules challenges accurate ab initio MD

             network potential energy surface (NNPES), deep potential (DP) model,
             adopted. The data set for the DP model of each fuel is constructed
             after 31 and 27 iterations, respectively. The high precision of the DP
             model is demonstrated, and the temperature transferability of each

             tends to form an unsaturated six-membered ring structure, while Fuel 2
             generates unsaturated open-chain hydrocarbons. Further analyses of the
             MD results provide time-evolution information on each component in the
             pyrolysis species pool. Compared to Fuel 1, the initial pyrolysis of
             Fuel 2 leads to more hydrogen, alkenes, and alkanes, as well as fewer
             monocyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (MAHs), demonstrating a reduced
             tendency for afterward coking. This work might contribute to the
             development of the mechanism of the two spiro-hydrocarbons and guide

             Numerical stability tests across a range of timesteps reveal excellent

             effect has the correlation of Ar <sub> He <sub>
             N2. The inhibitory effect of Ar is more pronounced compared to He due
             to the bigger effective radius and physical mass. Moreover, the
             addition of N2 introduced extra initiation reaction (H2{\,}+{\,}N2
             {\textrightarrow} NNH{\,}+{\,}H) and generated additional intermediate
             products such as NNH and N2OH, which result in the weakest inhibitory
             effect. Compared to diatomic inhibitors (e.g., N2), the monatomic
             inhibitors such as Ar and He exhibit stronger inhibitory effects on
             the hydroxide reaction under high pressure.},
